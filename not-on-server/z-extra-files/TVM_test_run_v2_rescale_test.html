			In review, we:</p>
		<p>Calculated the 1st year of interest by multiplying the interest rate, 10%, times the 1st year starting principal, $100.
		</p>
		<p>(100 * 10%) = 10</p>
		<p>Calculated the 2nd year of interest by finding 10% of the 2nd year starting principal, $110.
		</p>
		<p>(110 * 10%) = 11</p>
		<p>Added the 1st and 2nd year interest to the principal of $100.</p>

			In other words, we calculated the interest earned in each individual year and added all the interest payments back to the principal to find the Future Value (FV).</p>
		<p>Although, this method does produce the correct answer, what would you do if asked for the future value after 100 years? </p>
		<p>You could create a spreadsheet of formulas with 100 interest payment calculations. However, it’s time-consuming and fortunately unnecessary.</p>
		<p>Instead, we’ll derive a general equation that will allow you to solve for Future Value (FV ), Present Value ( PV ), interest rate (i) or number of </p>
		<p>years (n).</p>

		<p>There are a few principals and properties that you will need to know to follow along with the derivation of the equation.</p>
		<p>Princples of Algebra</p>
		<p>Order of Operations: PEMDAS</p>
		<p>Distributive Property</p>
		<p>FOIL</p>
		<p>Basic Princples of Algebra:</p>
		<p>Cancel out variables or numbers by doing the same thing (multiply, divide, raise to an exponent) on both sides of the equal sign.</p>
		<p>The reciprocal of a number is found by converting to a fraction and then switching the numerator and denominator. A number multiplied by its reciprocal equals 1. Therefore, reciprocals are useful for canceling numbers and exponents. Examples of reciprocals are:</p>
		<p>You’ll need to know the order of operations to understand the math that follows. Remember </p>
		<p>PEMDAS:</p>
		<p>Parentheses</p>
		<p>Exponents</p>
		Multiplication and

		Division (from left to right)

		Addition and
		</p>
		Subtraction (from left to right)

			We will use the Distributive Property to distribute a number that is multiplied by a polynomial in parentheses. For instance:</p>
		<p>The Distributive Property is easy enough to understand when real numbers are involved. However, it’s important to understand how to distribute with variables.</p>
		<p>The FOIL Method is a systematic way to multiply terms inside parentheses. The letters stand for:</p>
		<p>First</p>
		<p>Outer</p>
		<p>Inner</p>
		<p>Last</p>
		<p>For instance:</p>
		<p>Continue</p>
		<p>Back</p>
		<p>Now it’s just a matter of simplifying the formula and grouping like variables.</p>
		[(PV * i)] + [(PV * i) + PV] * i + PV
		<p>Start with the parentheses by multiplying the variables within.</p>
		<p>PV i + [PV + PV] * i + PV</p>
		<p>Distribute the multiplication to the variables within the middle bracket.</p>
		PVi + PVi2 + PVi + PV </p>

		5. The equation in the parentheses can be simpliefied to (x + 1)(x + 1). You may have seen this equation in the math help under FOIL</p>

	<p>6. Think of (i + 1) as a number. A number multiplied by itself is also known as squaring that number, which is what we will do here.</p>

	<p>7. Remember, back to the problem: the term is 2 years. Therefore, n = 2 and we can replace the number in the exponent with the variable.</p>

	<p>Adding FV to the other side of the equal sign, we arrive at:</p>

	<p>PV</p>
	<p>(1 + </p>
	<p>i</p>
	<p>)</p>
	<p>n</p>

	<p>We could continue to derive the equation for 3, 10, or 100 years. After a lot of algebraic manipulation, the outcome would be the same. It’s not so important that you’re able to repeat the derivation, but that you understand the equation can be derived from individual calculations.</p>

	<p>First, identify the variables from the problem:</p>

	<p>What would the $100 investment be worth in 10 years at 10%?</p>

	<p>PV = 100</p>

	<p>FV = ?</p>

	<p>i = 10% or 0.10</p>

	<p>n = 10</p>

	<p>Did you come up with the right numbers? Here are some tips:</p>

	<p> is a rate. Look for a percentage or decimal.</p>
	<p>n</p>
	<p> will be an expression of time; the number of years</p>
	<p>To distinguish between </p>
	<p>PV</p>
	<p> and </p>
	<p>FV</p>
	<p>, ask yourself whether the dollar amount is money you have now or in the future. Since the $100 is today’s investment, it must be PV. The question asks what it will be worth, indicating we want to find FV.</p>

	<p>Continue</p>

	<p>Back</p>

	<p>Then plug the numbers into the equation: </p>
	<p>PV = 100</p>

	<p>FV = ?</p>

	<p>i = 10% or 0.10</p>

	<p>n = 10</p>

	<p>1. Starting with the parentheses, add the numbers within.</p>
	<p>FV</p>
	<p> = </p>
	<p>PV</p>
	<p>(1 + </p>
	<p>i</p>

	<p>FV</p>
	<p> = </p>
	<p>100</p>

	<p>2. Next, apply the exponent. Be careful about rounding.</p>


	<p>FV </p>
	<p>= </p>
	<p>100</p>

	<p>Back</p>

	<p>So far we have calculated FV with the TVM equation and the Future Value Factor. A third way to calculate TVM is with a financial calculator. If you have a financial calculator, now would be a good time to make sure you know how to use it. Plug in the numbers to verify that the equation and calculator find the same FV.</p>

	<p>How much would the $100 grow in 10 years at 10%?</p>

	<p>Your calculator must be on End mode -- this is the most common mistake made on tests. Also, notice that PV and FV are opposite signs (+/-).</p>

	<p>You may find it difficult to identify PV and FV. In essence, this question asks how much interest it will take to turn $1 that you have today into $3 in 10 years.</p>

	<p>What interest rate (annual basis) is required for a deposit to double in </p>
	<p>10 years</p>
	<p>?</p>

	<p>The problem states that we want to double the investment, which means FV will be twice the amount of PV. You can use any numbers, as long as you maintain as the FV to PV ratio is 2:1. However, to cut out the need to simplify the math later, it’s best to start with FV = 2 and PV = 1.</p>

	<p>Hint: To solve for i, you will need to cancel out the exponent on the right side of the equation. Raise each side of the equation by the reciprocal of n. The reciprocal of 10 is 1/10, or 0.10</p>

	<p>Congratulations! You’ve completed the Basics section of the TVM Bootcamp.</p>

	<p>If you were confident answering the exercise questions and got most of them right, then you have a good grasp of the basics of TVM.</p>
	<p>If you were not able to answer most of the exercise questions correctly, contact your instructor for additional help.</p>
	<p>If you’re completing the full series of TVM tutorials, move on to the second Time Value of Money tutorial, which introduces compound interest.</p>
	<p>In the problem we just solved, the number in parentheses (below) is called the Future Value factor. In the ‘good old days’ before calculators, people used tables of pre-calculated Future Value factors to solve the TVM equation. Find the intersection of the number of periods (years) on the left and the interest rate at the top to find the Future Value factor. Then multiply PV times the Future Value factor to calculate FV.</p>
	<p>FV = PV(Future Value factor</p>
	<p>FV = (100 * 2.5937)</p>
	<p>FV = $259.37</p>
