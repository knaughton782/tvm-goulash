To figure out how much we will have in 1 year, we need first calculate the interest payment. The interest payment is calculated by multiplying the interest rate times the principal amount. Now, identify the interest rate and the principal in the word problem by clicking on the variables below.


How much money would you have in 1 year if you invested $100 at a rate of 10%

n is the number of years. Look for time-related words like year or decade.

The present value, or principal, is how much you have today. PV = $100

Interest is a rate and is usually accompanied by a % sign. i = 10%

After calculating the interest payment, you need to add the interest payment back to the initial investment (principal).

How much money would you have in 1 year if you invested $100 at a rate of 10%

Calculate the interest payment 10% x $100 = $10 Add the interest payment back to the initial investment (principal). $100 + $10 =$110

After calculating interest for the first year, you could use the same process to roll over the loan for a second year. Some find it a little more complicated. Answer this question: How much money would you have in another year if you rolled over the $110.00 earned in the first year?

Answer this question: How much money would you have in another year if you rolled over the $110.00? Let’s rephrase the question to a form you’re already familiar with: How much money would you have in a year if you invested $110 (calculated in the previous question) at 10% interest? To figure out how much we will have in 2 year, we need to: Calculate the interest payment for year 2. Add the interest payments back to the initial investment (principal).

Answer this question: How much money would you have in a year if you invested $110 at 10% interest? Calculate the interest payment for year 2. Recall that the interest rate is 10%. This time the principal is $110. To find the interest payment, we need to multiply the interest rate times the principal (Present Value) amount: 10% * $110 = $11

In review, we: Calculated the 1st year of interest by multiplying the interest rate, 10%, times the 1st year starting principal, $100. (100 * 10%) = 10 Calculated the 2nd year of interest by finding 10% of the 2nd year starting principal, $110. (110 * 10%) = 11 Added the 1st and 2nd year interest to the principal of $100. 100 + 10 + 11 = $121

In other words, we calculated the interest earned in each individual year and added all the interest payments back to the principal to find the Future Value (FV). Although, this method does produce the correct answer, what would you do if asked for the future value after 100 years? You could create a spreadsheet of formulas with 100 interest payment calculations. However, it’s time-consuming and fortunately unnecessary. Instead, we’ll derive a general equation that will allow you to solve for Future Value (FV), Present Value (PV), interest rate (i), or number of years (n).

There are a few principals and properties that you will need to know to follow along with the derivation of the equation.

Princples of Algebra

Order of Operations: PEMDAS

Distributive Property

FOIL



Basic Princples of Algebra: Cancel out variables or numbers by doing the same thing (multiply, divide, raise to an exponent) on both sides of the equal sign. The reciprocal of a number is found by converting to a fraction and then switching the numerator and denominator. A number multiplied by its reciprocal equals 1. Therefore, reciprocals are useful for canceling numbers and exponents. Examples of reciprocals are:

You’ll need to know the order of operations to understand the math that follows. Remember PEMDAS: Parentheses Exponents Multiplication and Division (from left to right) Addition and Subtraction (from left to right) You may have also learned this as: “Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally.”

We will use the Distributive Property to distribute a number that is multiplied by a polynomial in parentheses. For instance:

The Distributive Property is easy enough to understand when real numbers are involved. However, it’s important to understand how to distribute with variables.

The FOIL Method is a systematic way to multiply terms inside parentheses. The letters stand for: First Outer Inner Last For instance:

5. The equation in the parentheses can be simpliefied to (x + 1)(x + 1). You may have seen this equation in the math help under FOIL 6. Think of (i + 1) as a number. A number multiplied by itself is also known as squaring that number, which is what we will do here. 7. Remember, back to the problem: the term is 2 years. Therefore, n = 2 and we can replace the number in the exponent with the variable.

Adding FV to the other side of the equal sign, we arrive at: FV = PV(1 + i)n We could continue to derive the equation for 3, 10, or 100 years. After a lot of algebraic manipulation, the outcome would be the same. It’s not so important that you’re able to repeat the derivation, but that you understand the equation can be derived from individual calculations.

"First, identify the variables from the problem: What would the $100 investment be worth in 10 years at 10%? PV = 100 FV = ? i = 10% or 0.10 n = 10 Did you come up with the right numbers? Here are some tips: i is a rate. Look for a percentage or decimal. n will be an expression of time; the number of years To distinguish between PV and FV, ask yourself whether the dollar amount is money you have now or in the future. Since the $100 is today’s investment, it must be PV. The question asks what it will be worth, indicating we want to find FV.

TVM: The BasicsEquation

Then plug the numbers into the equation: PV = 100 FV = ? i = 10% or 0.10 n = 10 1. Starting with the parentheses, add the numbers within.

FV = PV(1 + i)n

FV = 100(1 + 0.10)10

FV = 100(1.10)10

2. Next, apply the exponent. Be careful about rounding.

FV = 100(2.5937424601)

3. Finally, multiply.

FV = $259.37

TVM: The BasicsEquation

In the problem we just solved, the number in parentheses (below) is called the Future Value factor. In the ‘good old days’ before calculators, people used tables of pre-calculated Future Value factors to solve the TVM equation. Find the intersection of the number of periods (years) on the left and the interest rate at the top to find the Future Value factor. Then multiply PV times the Future Value factor to calculate FV.

FV = PV(Future Value factor FV = (100 * 2.5937) FV = $259.37

So far we have calculated FV with the TVM equation and the Future Value Factor. A third way to calculate TVM is with a financial calculator. If you have a financial calculator, now would be a good time to make sure you know how to use it. Plug in the numbers to verify that the equation and calculator find the same FV.

Solution If I know that I want to give my child $20,000 for college on his 18th birthday, how much will I need to invest at 7% when the child is born?

Variables PV = ? FV = 20000 i = 0.07 n = 18

FV = PV(1+i)n 20000 = PV(1+0.07)18 20000 = PV(1.07)18 20000 = PV(3.37993228)
