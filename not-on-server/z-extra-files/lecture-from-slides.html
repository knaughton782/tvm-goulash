        This is the first of four tutorials on the Time Value of Money. In this first part, weâ€™ll start with the basic equation and variables. Subsequent tutorials will add complexity by introducing compound interest, payments, and annuities.

            One of the central concepts of finance:
            a dollar today is worth more than a dollar in the futurre
            in other words, in order to b compesated for delayin ga dolalr today for a dollar in the future, one must receive an additional benefit (interest).

            One of the central concepts of finance:
            a dollar today is worth more than a dollar in the futurre
            intuitively you already understand that today's dollar is worth more than tomorrow's dollar. The market operates on this principal every day.
            When you don't have enough cash to uy soething you want, you can pay with a credit card; when you pay the bill, you must also pay some interest to compensate the credit card comany for lending you money.
            Conversly if you deposit money in a savings account the bank pays you interest to comepnsate you for lending them money.
